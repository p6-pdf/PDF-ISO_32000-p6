            (Optional) A name specifying the circumstances under which the annotation shall be activated. Valid values are:

          <P>
            PO The annotation shall be activated as soon as the page containing the annotation is opened. 
          </P>

            PV The annotation shall be activated as soon as any part of the page containing the annotation becomes visible. 
          </P>
          <P>
            XA The annotation shall remain inactive until explicitly activated by a script or user action.

          <P>
            NOTE 1 At any one time, only a single page shall be considered open in a conforming reader, even though more than one page may be visible, depending on the page layout.
            <P>
              Default value: XA.

          <P>
            NOTE 2 For performance reasons, documents intended for viewing in a web browser should use explicit activation (XA). In non-interactive applications, such as printing systems or aggregating conforming reader, PO and PV indicate that the annotation shall be activated when the page is printed or placed; XA indicates that the annotation shall never be activated and the normal appearance shall be used.

            (Optional; PDF 1.7) A flag indicating the default behavior of the user interface for viewing or managing information about the 3D artwork. Such user interfaces can enable navigation to different views or can depict the hierarchy of the objects in the artwork (the model tree). If true, the user interface should be made visible when the annotation is activated. If false, the user interface should not be made visible by default.
