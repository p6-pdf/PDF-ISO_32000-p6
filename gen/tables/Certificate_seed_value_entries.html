            (Optional; PDF 1.7) An array of dictionaries, each specifying a Subject Distinguished Name (DN) that shall be present within the certificate for it to be acceptable for signing. The certificate ultimately used for the digital signature shall contain all the attributes specified in each of the dictionaries in this array. (PDF keys and values are mapped to certificate attributes and values.) The certificate is not constrained to use only attribute entries from these dictionaries but may contain additional attributes.The Subject Distinguished Name is described in RFC 3280 (see the 
            <Link>
              Bibliography
            </Link>
            ). The key can be any legal attribute 
            identifier (OID). Attribute names shall contain characters in the set a-z A-Z 0-9 and PERIOD.
          </P>
          <P>
            Certificate attribute names are used as key names in the dictionaries in this array. Values of the attributes are used as values of the keys. Values shall be text strings.

          <P>
            (Optional; PDF 1.7) An array of ASCII strings, where each string specifies an acceptable key-usage extension that shall be present in the signing certificate. Multiple strings specify a range of acceptable key-usage extensions. The key-usage extension is described in RFC 3280. 
          </P>
          <P>
            Each character in a string represents a key-usage type, where the order of the characters indicates the key-usage extension it represents. The first through ninth characters in the string, from left to right, represent the required value for the following key-usage extensions:

            Any additional characters shall be ignored. Any missing characters or characters that are not one of the following values, shall be treated as ‘X’. The following character values shall be supported:
          </P>
          <P>
            0  Corresponding key-usage shall not be set.

            1  Corresponding key-usage shall be set.
          </P>

            X  State of the corresponding key-usage does not matter.

            EXAMPLE 1 The string values ‘1’ and ‘1XXXXXXXX’ represent settings where the key-usage type digitalSignature is set and the state of all other key-usage types do not matter.

            EXAMPLE 2 An example of such a string is: (2.16.840.1.113733.1.7.1.1).
