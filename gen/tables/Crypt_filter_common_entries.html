          <P>

              "Algorithm 1: Encryption of data using the RC4 or AES 
              algorithms"

          </P>
          <P>
            AESV2(PDF 1.6) The application shall ask the security handler for the encryption key and shall implicitly decrypt data with 
            <Link>
              "Algorithm 1: Encryption of data using the RC4 or AES 
              algorithms"

            Chaining (CBC) mode with a 16-byte block size and an initialization vector that shall be randomly generated and placed as the first 16 bytes in the stream or string. 
          </P>
          <P>
            When the value is V2 or AESV2, the application may ask once for this encryption key and cache the key for subsequent use for streams that use the same crypt filter. Therefore, there shall be a one-to-one relationship between a crypt filter name and the corresponding encryption key.
          </P>
          <P>
            Only the values listed here shall be supported. Applications that encounter other values shall report that the file is encrypted with an unsupported algorithm.

          <P>
            DocOpen: Authorization shall be required when a document is opened.

            (Optional) The bit length of the encryption key. It shall be a multiple of 8 in the range of 40 to 128. 
          </P>
          <P>
            Security handlers may define their own use of the Length entry and should use it to define the bit length of the encryption key. Standard security handler expresses the length in multiples of 8 (16 means 128) and public-key security handler expresses it as is (128 means 128).
