            Adobe standard Latin-text encoding. This is the built-in encoding defined in Type 1 Latin-text font programs (but generally not in TrueType font programs). Conforming readers shall not have a predefined encoding named StandardEncoding. However, it is necessary to describe this encoding, since a font’s built-in encoding can be used as the base encoding from which differences may be specified in an encoding dictionary.

            Encoding for text strings in a PDF document outside the document’s content streams. This is one of two encodings (the other being Unicode) that may be used to represent text strings; see

            PDFDocEncoding; it is not customary to use this encoding to show text from fonts.

            An encoding for use with expert fonts—ones containing the expert character set. Conforming readers shall have a predefined encoding named MacExpertEncoding. Despite its name, it is not a platform-specific encoding; however, only certain fonts have the appropriate character set for use with this encoding. No such fonts are among the standard 14 predefined fonts.
