            (One item for each shared object referenced from the page) The numerator of the fractional position for each shared object reference, which shall be in the same order as the preceding item. The fraction shall indicate where in the page’s content stream the shared object is first referenced. This item shall be interpreted as the numerator of a fraction whose denominator is specified once for the entire document (
            <Link>

              F. 3

            , item 13). 
          </P>
          <P>
            EXAMPLE If the denominator is d, a numerator ranging from 0 to d
            -
            1 indicates the corresponding portion of the page’s content stream. For example, if the denominator is 4, a numerator of 0, 1, 2, or 3 indicates that the first reference lies in the first, second, third, or fourth quarter of the content stream, respectively. 
            <P>
              There are two (or more) other possible values for the numerator, which shall indicate that the shared object is not referenced from the content stream but instead is needed by annotations or other objects that are drawn after the contents. The value d shall indicate that the shared object is needed before image XObjects and other nonshared objects that are at the end of the page. A value of d
              
              1 or greater shall indicate that the shared object is needed after those objects. 
            </P>

          <P>
            NOTE This method of dividing the page into fractions is only approximate. Determining the first reference to a shared object entails inspecting the unencoded content stream. The relationship between positions in the unencoded and encoded streams is not necessarily linear.
