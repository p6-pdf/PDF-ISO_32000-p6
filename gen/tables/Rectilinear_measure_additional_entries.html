            (Required) A text string expressing the scale ratio of the drawing in the region corresponding to this dictionary. Universally recognized unit abbreviations should be used, either matching those of the number format arrays in this dictionary or those of commonly used scale ratios.

            EXAMPLE 1 a common scale in architectural drawings is “1/4 in = 1 ft”, indicating that 1/4 inches in default user space is equivalent to 1 foot in real-world measurements. 
            <P>
              If the scale ratio differs in the x and y directions, both scales should be specified.

            (Optional; meaningful only when Y is present) A factor that shall be used to convert the largest units along the y axis to the largest units along the x axis. It shall be used for calculations (distance, area, and angle) where the units are be equivalent; if not specified, these calculations may not be performed (which would be the case in situations such as x representing time and yrepresenting temperature). Other calculations (change in x, change in y, and slope) shall not require this value.
