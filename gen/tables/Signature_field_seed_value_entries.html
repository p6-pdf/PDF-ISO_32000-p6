A value of 0 indicates that the associated entry is an optional constraint. Bit positions are 1 (Filter); 2 (SubFilter); 3 (V); 4 (Reasons); 5 (LegalAttestation); 6 (AddRevInfo); and 7 (DigestMethod). Default value: 0.

Beginning with PDF 1.7, if Filter is specified and the Ff entry indicates this entry is a required constraint, then the signature handler specified by this entry shall be used when signing; otherwise, signing shall not take place. If Ff indicates that this is an optional constraint, this handler may be used if it is available. If it is not available, a different handler may be used instead.

If SubFilter is specified and the Ff entry indicates that this entry is a required constraint, then the first matching encodings shall be used when signing; otherwise, signing shall not take place. If Ff indicates that this is an optional constraint, then the first matching encoding shall be used if it is available. If none is available, a different encoding may be used.
