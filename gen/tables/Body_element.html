          <P>
            software_name identifies the software by name. It shall not contain spaces.

          <P>
            software_version identifies the version of the software. It consists of a series of integers separated by decimal points. Each integer is a version number, the leftmost value being a major version number, with values to the right increasingly minor. When comparing strings, the versions shall be compared in order. 
          </P>
          <P>
            NOTE “5.2” is less than “5.13” because 2 is less than 13; the string is not treated as a decimal number. When comparing strings with different numbers of sections, the string with fewer sections is implicitly padded on the right with sections containing “0” to make the number of sections equivalent.
