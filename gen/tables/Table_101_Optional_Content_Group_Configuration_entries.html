          <P>
            Optional content group dictionaries, whose Name entry shall bedisplayed in the user interface by the conforming reader.
          </P>
          <P>
            Arrays of optional content groups which may be displayed by a conforming reader in a tree or outline structure. Each nested array may optionally have as its first element a text string to be used as a non-selectable label in a conforming reader’s user interface.

            Text labels in nested arrays shall be used to present collections of related optional content groups, and not to communicate actual nesting of content inside multiple layers of groups (see

            actual nesting of groups in the content, such as for layers with sublayers, nested arrays of groups without a text label shall be used (see

However, turning a group from ON to OFF does not force any other group to be turned ON.

            (Optional; PDF 1.6) An array of optional content groups that shall belocked when this configuration is applied. The state of a locked group cannot be changed through the user interface of a conforming reader. Conforming writers can use this entry to prevent the visibility of content that depends on these groups from being changed by users.

            A conforming reader may allow the states of optional content groups from being changed by means other than the user interface, such as JavaScript or items in the AS entry of a configuration dictionary.
