            If set, the document contains at least one signature field. This flag allows a conforming reader to enable user interface items (such as menu items or pushbuttons) related to signature processing without having to scan the entire document for the presence of signature fields.

            If set, the document contains signatures that may be invalidated if the file is saved (written) in a way that alters its previous contents, as opposed to an incremental update. Merely updating the file by appending new information to the end of the previous version is safe (see 
            <Link>
              H.7, “Updating Example”
            </Link>
            ). Conforming readers may use 
            this flag to inform a user requesting a full save that signatures will be invalidated and require explicit confirmation before continuing with the operation.
