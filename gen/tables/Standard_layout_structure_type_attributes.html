            When applied to an ILSE, any value except Inline shall cause the element to be treated as a BLSE instead. Default value: Inline.

          <P>
            Elements with Placement values of Before, Start, or End shall be removed from the normal stacking or packing process and allowed to float to the specified edge of the enclosing reference area or parent BLSE. Multiple such floating elements may be positioned adjacent to one another against the specified edge of the reference area or placed serially against the edge, in the order encountered. Complex cases such as floating elements that interfere with each other or do not fit on the same page may be handled differently by different conforming readers. Tagged PDF merely identifies the elements as floating and indicates their desired placement.

            TbRl Inline progression from top to bottom; block progression from right to left. This is the typical writing mode for Chinese and Japanese writing systems.

            The specified layout directions shall apply to the given structure element and all of its descendants to any level of nesting. Default value: LrTb. 
          </P>
          <P>
            For elements that produce multiple columns, the writing mode defines the direction of column progression within the reference area: the inline direction determines the stacking direction for columns and the default flow order of text from column to column. For tables, the writing mode controls the layout of rows and columns: table rows (structure type TR) shall be stacked in the block direction, cells within a row (structure type TD) in the inline direction. 
          </P>
          <P>
            The inline-progression direction specified by the writing mode is subject to local override within the text being laid out, as described in Unicode Standard Annex 9, The Bidirectional Algorithm, available from the Unicode Consortium (see the

            (Optional; not inheritable; PDF 1.5) The style of an element’s border. Specifies the stroke pattern of each edge of a table cell or any element’s content rectangle (possibly adjusted by the Paddingattribute). There are two forms:

              Dotted The border is a series of dots.

              Solid The border is a single line segment.
            </P>
            <P>
              Double The border is two solid lines. The sum of the two lines and the space between them equals the value of BorderThickness.

              Groove The border looks as though it were carved into the canvas.

              Inset The border makes the entire box look as though it were embedded in the canvas.

              All borders shall be drawn on top of the box’s background. The colour of borders drawn for values of Groove, Ridge, Inset, and Outset shall depend on the structure element’s BorderColor attribute and the colour of the background over which the border is being drawn.
