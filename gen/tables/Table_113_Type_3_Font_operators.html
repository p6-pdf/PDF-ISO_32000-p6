              This operator shall only be permitted in a content stream appearing in a Type

               denote the upper-right corner, of the glyph bounding box. The glyph bounding box is the smallest rectangle, oriented with the axes of the glyph coordinate system, that completely encloses all marks placed on the page as a result of executing the glyph’s description. The declared bounding box shall be correct—in other words, sufficiently large to enclose the entire glyph. If any marks fall outside this bounding box, the result is unpredictable. 
            </P>
            <P>
              A glyph description that begins with the d1 operator should not execute any operators that set the colour (or other colour-related parameters) in the graphics state; any use of such operators shall be ignored. The glyph description is executed solely to determine the glyph’s shape. Its colour shall be determined by the graphics state in effect each time this glyph is painted by a text-showing operator. For the same reason, the glyph description shall not include an image; however, an image mask is acceptable, since it merely defines a region of the page to be painted with the current colour.

            <P>
              This operator shall be used only in a content stream appearing in a Type
              3 font’s CharProcs dictionary.
