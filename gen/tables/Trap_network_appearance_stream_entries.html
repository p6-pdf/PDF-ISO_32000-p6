            (Required) The name of the process colour model that was assumed when this trap network was created; equivalent to the PostScript page device parameter ProcessColorModel (see Section 6.2.5 of the PostScript Language Reference, Third Edition). Valid values are DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, DeviceCMY, DeviceRGBK, and DeviceN.

When the trapping zones and parameters are defined by an external job ticket (or by some other means, such as JDF), this entry shall be absent.
