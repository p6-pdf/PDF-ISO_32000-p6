            In a PDF whose version is 1.1 and earlier, all named resources used in the form XObject shall be included in the resource dictionary of each page object on which the form XObject appears, regardless of whether they also appear in the resource dictionary of the form XObject. These resources should also be specified in the form XObject’s resource dictionary as well, to determine which resources are used inside the form XObject. If a resource is included in both dictionaries, it shall have the same name in both locations. 
          </P>
          <P>
            In PDF 1.2 and later versions, form XObjects may be independent of the content streams in which they appear, and this is strongly recommended although not required. In an independent form XObject, the resource dictionary of the form XObject is required and shall contain all named resources used by the form XObject. These resources shall not be promoted to the outer content stream’s resource dictionary, although that stream’s resource dictionary refers to the form XObject.
