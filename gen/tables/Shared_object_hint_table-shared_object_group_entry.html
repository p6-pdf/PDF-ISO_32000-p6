            A number equal to 1 less than the number of objects in the group. The first object of the first page shall be the one whose object number is given by the O entry in the linearization parameter dictionary at the beginning of the file. Object numbers for subsequent entries can be determined by accumulating the number of objects in all previous entries until all shared objects in the first page have been enumerated. Following that, the first object in the shared objects section has a number that can be obtained from the header section of the shared object hint table (
