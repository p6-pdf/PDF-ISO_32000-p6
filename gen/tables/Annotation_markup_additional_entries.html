            <Link>
              11.2, “Overview of Transparency,”
            </Link>

            ). This value shall apply to 
            all visible elements of the annotation in its closed state (including its background and border) but not to the pop-up window that appears when the annotation is opened. 
          </P>
          <P>
            The specified value shall not used if the annotation has an appearance stream (see 
            <Link>
              12.5.5, “Appearance Streams”
            </Link>
            ); in that case, the appearance 
            stream shall specify any transparency. (However, if the compliant viewer regenerates the annotation’s appearance stream, it may incorporate the CA value into the stream’s content.)
          </P>
          <P>
            The implicit blend mode (see 
            <Link>

            ”) is Normal. Default 
            value: 1.0. 
          </P>
          <P>
            If no explicit appearance stream is defined for the annotation, it may bepainted by implementation-dependent means that do not necessarily conform to the PDF imaging model; in this case, the effect of this entry is implementation-dependent as well.
