role ISO_32000::File_specification {
    method Type {...};	#| [name] (Required if an EF or RF entry is present; recommended always) The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes; is Filespec for a file specification dictionary.
    method FS {...};	#| [name] (Optional) The name of the file system that is used to interpret this file specification. If this entry is present, all other entries in the dictionary is interpreted by the designated file system. PDF shall define only one standard file system name, URL (see Link 7.11.5, "URL Specifications" ); an application can register other names (see Link Annex E ). This entry is independent of the F, UF, DOS, Mac, and Unix entries.
    method F {...};	#| [string] (Required if the DOS, Mac, and Unix entries are all absent; amended with the UF entry for PDF 1.7) A file specification string of the form described in Link 7.11.2, "File Specification Strings," or (if the file system is URL) a uniform resource locator, as described in Link 7.11.5, "URL Specifications."
	#| The UF entry should be used in addition to the F entry. The UF entry provides cross-platform and cross-language compatibility and the F entry provides backwards compatibility.
    method UF {...};	#| [text string] (Optional, but recommended if the F entry exists in the dictionary; PDF 1.7) A Unicode text string that provides file specification of the form described in Link 7.11.2, "File Specification Strings." This is a text string encoded using PDFDocEncoding or UTF-16BE with a leading byte-order marker (as defined in Link 7.9.2.2, "Text String Type" ). The F entry should be included along with this entry for backwards compatibility reasons.
    method DOS {...};	#| [byte string] (Optional) A file specification string (see Link 7.11.2, "File Specification Strings" ) representing a DOS file name.
	#| This entry is obsolescent and should not be used by conforming writers.
    method Mac {...};	#| [byte string] (Optional) A file specification string (see Link 7.11.2, "File Specification Strings" ) representing a Mac OS file name.
	#| This entry is obsolescent and should not be used by conforming writers.
    method Unix {...};	#| [byte string] (Optional) A file specification string (see Link 7.11.2, "File Specification Strings" ) representing a UNIX file name.
	#| This entry is obsolescent and should not be used by conforming writers.
    method ID {...};	#| [array] (Optional) An array of two byte strings constituting a file identifier (see Link 14.4, "File Identifiers" ) that should be included in the referenced file.
	#| NOTE The use of this entry improves an applicationâ€™s chances of finding the intended file and allows it to warn the user if the file has changed since the link was made.
    method V {...};	#| [boolean] (Optional; PDF 1.2) A flag indicating whether the file referenced by the file specification is volatile (changes frequently with time). If the value is true, applications shall not cache a copy of the file. For example, a movie annotation referencing a URL to a live video camera could set this flag to trueto notify the conforming reader that it should re-acquire the movie each time it is played. Default value: false.
    method EF {...};	#| [dictionary] (Required if RF is present; PDF 1.3; amended to include the UF key in PDF 1.7) A dictionary containing a subset of the keys F, UF, DOS, Mac, and Unix, corresponding to the entries by those names in the file specification dictionary. The value of each such key is an embedded file stream (see Link 7.11.4, "Embedded File Streams" ) containing the corresponding file. If this entry is present, the Type entry is required and the file specification dictionary is indirectly referenced.
	#| The F and UF entries should be used in place of the DOS, Mac, or Unixentries.
    method RF {...};	#| [dictionary] (Optional; PDF 1.3) A dictionary with the same structure as the EF dictionary, which is present. Each key in the RF dictionary shall also be present in the EF dictionary. Each value is a related files array (see Link 7.11.4.2, "Related Files Arrays" ) identifying files that are related to the corresponding file in the EF dictionary. If this entry is present, the Type entry is required and the file specification dictionary is indirectly referenced.
    method Desc {...};	#| [text string] (Optional; PDF 1.6) Descriptive text associated with the file specification. It is used for files in the EmbeddedFiles name tree (see Link 7.7.4, "Name Dictionary" ).
    method CI {...};	#| [dictionary] (Optional; is indirect reference; PDF 1.7) A collection item dictionary, which is used to create the user interface for portable collections (see Link 7.11.6, "Collection Items" ).
