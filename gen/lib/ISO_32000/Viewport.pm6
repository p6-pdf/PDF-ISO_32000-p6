=head2 Type [name]
- (Optional) The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes; is Viewport for a viewport dictionary.

This ordering shall determine the orientation of the measuring coordinate system (that is, the direction of the positive x and yaxes) in this viewport, which may have a different rotation from the page.
The coordinates of this rectangle are independent of the origin of the measuring coordinate system, specified in the O entry (see Table 262) of the measurement dictionary specified by Measure.

=head2 Name [text string]
- (Optional) A descriptive text string or title of the viewport, intended for use in a user interface.

=head2 Measure [dictionary]
