=head1 Methods (Entries)

=head2 Type [name]
- (Optional). The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes; if present, is 3DAnimationStyle.

=head2 Subtype [name]
- (Optional) The animation style described by this dictionary; see
Table 302
for valid values. If an animation style is encountered other than those described in
Table 302
, an animation style of None is used.
Default value: None

=head2 PC [integer]
- (Optional) An integer specifying the play count for this animation style. A non-negative integer represents the number of times the animation is played. A negative integer indicates that the animation is infinitely repeated. This value is ignored for animation styles of type None.
Default value: 0

=head2 TM [number]
- (Optional) A positive number specifying the time multiplier to be used when running the animation. A value greater than one shortens the time it takes to play the animation, or effectively speeds up the animation.
NOTE This allows authors to adjust the desired speed of animations, without having to re-author the 3D artwork.
This value is ignored for animation styles of type None.
Default value: 1
