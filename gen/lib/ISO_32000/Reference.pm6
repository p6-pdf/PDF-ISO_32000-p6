    method F {...};	#| [file specification] (Required) The file containing the target document.
    method Page {...};	#| [integer or text string] (Required) A page index or page label (see Link 12.4.2, "Page Labels" ) identifying the page of the target document containing the content to be imported. This reference is a weak one and may be inadvertently invalidated if the referenced page is changed or replaced in the target document after the reference is created.
    method ID {...};	#| [array] (Optional) An array of two byte strings constituting a file identifier (see Link 14.4, "File Identifiers" ) for the file containing the target document. The use of this entry improves an readerâ€™s chances of finding the intended file and allows it to warn the user if the file has changed since the reference was created.
