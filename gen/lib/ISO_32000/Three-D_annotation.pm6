    method Subtype {...};	#| [name] (Required) The type of annotation that this dictionary describes; shall be 3D for a 3D annotation.
    $?ROLE.^add_method("3DD", method {...}); # (Required) A 3D stream (see Link 13.6.3, “3D Streams” ) or 3D reference dictionary (see Link 13.6.3.3, “3D Reference Dictionaries” ) that specifies the 3D artwork to be shown.
    $?ROLE.^add_method("3DV", method {...}); # (Optional) An object that specifies the default initial view of the 3D artwork that shall be used when the annotation is activated. It may be either a 3D view dictionary (see Link 13.6.4, “3D Views” ) or one of the following types specifying an element in the VA array in the 3D stream (see Link Ta b l e 300 ):
	# • An integer specifying an index into the VA array.
	# • A text string matching the IN entry in one of the views in the VAarray.
	# • A name that indicates the first (F), last (L), or default (D) entries in the VA array. Default value: the default view in the 3D stream object specified by 3DD.
    $?ROLE.^add_method("3DA", method {...}); # (Optional) An activation dictionary (see Link Table 299 ) that defines the times at which the annotation shall be activated and deactivated and the state of the 3D artwork instance at those times. Default value: an activation dictionary containing default values for all its entries.
    $?ROLE.^add_method("3DI", method {...}); # (Optional) A flag indicating the primary use of the 3D annotation. If true, it is intended to be interactive; if false, it is intended to be manipulated programmatically, as with a JavaScript animation. Conforming readers may present different user interface controls for interactive 3D annotations (for example, to rotate, pan, or zoom the artwork) than for those managed by a script or other mechanism.
	# Default value: true.
    $?ROLE.^add_method("3DB", method {...}); # (Optional) The 3D view box, which is the rectangular area in which the 3D artwork shall be drawn. It shall be within the rectangle specified by the annotation’s Rect entry and shall be expressed in the annotation’s target coordinate system (see discussion following this Table).
	# Default value: the annotation’s Rect entry, expressed in the target coordinate system. This value is [ -w/2 -h/2 w/2 h/2 ], where w and h are the width and height, respectively, of Rect.
