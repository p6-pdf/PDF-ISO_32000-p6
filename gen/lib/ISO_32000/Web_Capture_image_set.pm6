    method S {...};	#| [name] (Required) The subtype of content set that this dictionary describes; is SIS.
    method R {...};	#| [integer or array] (Required) The reference counts for the image XObjects belonging to the image set. For an image set containing a single XObject, the value is the integer reference count for that XObject. For an image set containing multiple XObjects, the value is an array of reference counts parallel to the O array (see Link Table 352 ); that is, each element in the R array shall hold the reference count for the image XObject at the corresponding position in the O array.
