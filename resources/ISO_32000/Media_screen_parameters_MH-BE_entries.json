This colour is used if the media object does not entirely cover the rectangle or if it has transparent sections. It is ignored for hidden windows.\nDefault value: implementation-defined. The conforming reader should choose a reasonable value based on the value of W.\nEXAMPLE 1 A system default background colour for floating windows or a user-preferred background colour for full-screen windows. If a media format has an intrinsic background colour, B does not override it. However, the B colour is visible if the media has transparent areas or otherwise does not cover the entire window."
