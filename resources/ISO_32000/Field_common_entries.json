However, a non-terminal field does not logically have a type of its own; it is merely a container for inheritable attributes that are intended for descendant terminal fields of any type."

In a terminal field, the Kids array ordinarily shall refer to one or more separate widget annotations that are associated with this field. However, if there is only one associated widget annotation, and its contents have been merged into the field dictionary, Kids is omitted."
