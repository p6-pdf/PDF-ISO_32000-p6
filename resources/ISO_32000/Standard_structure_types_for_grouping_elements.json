A TOC entry that includes other nested TOC entries (and possibly TOCI entries) represents a more complex hierarchy. Ideally, the hierarchy of a top level TOC entry reflects the structure of the main body of the document.\nNOTE 2 Lists of figures and tables, as well as bibliographies, can be treated as tables of contents for purposes of the standard structure types."
