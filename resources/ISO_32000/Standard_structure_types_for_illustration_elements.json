If the element omits a Role attribute (see Table 348), it has only one child: an object reference (see 14.7.4.3, “PDF Objects as Content Items”) identifying the widget annotation. The annotations’ appearance stream (see 12.5.5, “Appearance Streams”) shall describe the appearance of the form element."
