For each entry in this dictionary, the key is a colorant name and the value is an array defining a Separation colour space for that colorant (see 8.6.6.4, \"Separation Colour Spaces\"). The key shall match the colorant name given in that colour space.\nThis dictionary provides information about the individual colorants that may be useful to some conforming readers. In particular, the alternate colour space and tint transformation function of a Separation colour space describe the appearance of that colorant alone, whereas those of a DeviceN colour space describe only the appearance of its colorants in combination.\nIf Subtype is NChannel, this dictionary has entries for all spot colorants in this colour space. This dictionary may also include additional colorants not used by this colour space."
