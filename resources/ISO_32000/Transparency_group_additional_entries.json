In the normal case in which the page is imposed directly on the output medium, the page group is effectively isolated and the specified I value is ignored. But if the page is in turn used as an element of some other page, it is treated as if it were a transparency group XObject; the I value is interpreted in the normal way to determine whether the page group is isolated."
