Such a difference may occur in situations where a border effect (described by BE) causes the size of the Rect to increase beyond that of the square or circle.\nThe four numbers shall correspond to the differences in default user space between the left, top, right, and bottom coordinates of Rect and those of the square or circle, respectively. Each value is greater than or equal to 0. The sum of the top and bottom differences is less than the height of Rect, and the sum of the left and right differences is less than the width of Rect."
