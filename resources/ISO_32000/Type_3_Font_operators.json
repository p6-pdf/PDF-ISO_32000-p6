The glyph description is executed solely to determine the glyph’s shape. Its colour is determined by the graphics state in effect each time this glyph is painted by a text-showing operator. For the same reason, the glyph description shall not include an image; however, an image mask is acceptable, since it merely defines a region of the page to be painted with the current colour.\nThis operator is used only in a content stream appearing in a Type 3 font’s CharProcs dictionary."
